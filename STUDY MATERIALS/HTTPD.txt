						How to install Apache on RHEL 8 / CentOS 8 Linux
						````````````````````````````````````````````````
*First step is to use dnf command to install package called httpd:

	# dnf install httpd

*Run and enable the Apache webserver to start after reboot:

	# systemctl enable httpd
	# systemctl start httpd

*Optionally, if you need your Apache web server to be accessed from remote locations open HTTP firewall port 80:

	# firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-service=http
	# firewall-cmd --reload

*Insert your website files.
 By default the Apache web server will greet you with a default welcome page.To disable the default Apache welcome page insert your index.html into /var/www/html/  directory. For example:

	echo Apache on RHEL 8 / CentOS 8 > /var/www/html/index.html

*Access your website.

 To access your new sample website navigate your web browser to either 
 http://YOUR-APACHE-IP-ADDRESS or 
 http://YOUR-APACHE-HOSTNAME. 
 For example http://192.168.1.151.

						How to start service on boot with RHEL 8 / CentOS 8 Linux

*Obtain the service name you wish to enable to start on boot.
 There are many ways on how to accomplish this task. Perhaps the simplest solution is to list all currently disabled services using the systemctl command:
	
	# systemctl list-unit-files --state=disabled

*The above command will create a long list of disabled services. Scroll through the list to find the service you wish to enable and take a note of the service name.   For example httpd.service
 Use the systemctl command to enable the service in order to start after system boot. Note the suffix .service can be omitted:
	
	# systemctl enable httpd

 In the above example we heave enabled the Apache httpd service to start during the system boot.

*If you later on decide to disable any service to start on boot use the systemctl command once again as follows:
	
	# systemctl disable httpd
